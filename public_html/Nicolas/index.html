            Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Who am I making this out to? Say it in Russian! Your best is an idiot! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
            Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

            Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Your best is an idiot! Say what? Ooh, name it after me!
            Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

            Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
            You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Say it in Russian! You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

            It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
            Hello, little man. I will destroy you! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You don't know how to do any of those. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
          </p>

            Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
            Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
            It must be wonderful. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I had more, but you go ahead. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!
